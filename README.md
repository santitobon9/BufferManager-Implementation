# BufferManager-Implementation
This is a implementation of a simple buffer pool management layer in a simple database management system. The goal of this was to get familiar with disk and buffer pool management. 
We implemented algorithms for pinning and unpinning pages from the buffer pool. We also implemented a clock replacement policy for determining which pages should be unpinned when the buffer is full.
